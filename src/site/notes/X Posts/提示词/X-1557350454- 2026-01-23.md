1. Style & Medium:
Isometric 2.5D pixel art illustration, architectural cross-section diorama, cute, whimsical, charming, detailed.
2. Core Concept:
"The Stacked Suitcase Hotel." A teetering tower of 5 vintage suitcases of various sizes and colors, precariously stacked. Each case is a unique micro-room for a traveler.
3. Aesthetic & Atmosphere :
Wes Anderson inspired color palette (pastel pinks, muted yellows, soft blues, warm browns), nostalgic, retro-futurism, literary and artistic vibe, symmetrical composition despite the wobbly stack.
4. Level Details:
L1 (Base Foundation): The Explorer's Lobby.
A giant, worn brown leather trunk covered in vintage postage stamps. Inside: A reception desk overflowing with antique globes and old maps. A cute pixel corgi dog is guarding the entrance.
L2 (Blue Hard-Shell): The Seaside Souvenir Shop.
A bright blue case. Interior packed with ocean elements: surfboards hanging, shelves cluttered with seashells, ships-in-bottles, and miniature lighthouse models. The floor is sandy beige.
L3 (Green Carry-on): The Botanist's Greenhouse.
A green hand-luggage case popped slightly open, with massive tropical foliage plants bursting out. Inside is lush with climbing vines, hanging potted plants, and pixel butterflies flying around.
L4 (The Sticker Trunk): Darkroom & Film Lab.
Exterior plastered with international travel stickers. Inside: Freshly developed black and white pixel photos hanging on clotheslines, bathed in a moody red darkroom safelight. Vintage cameras piled up like mountains.
L5 (Top Vanity Case): The Pilot's Attic.
A tiny, exquisite red makeup case perched on top. A telescope poking out of a small window. Flight goggles and leather pilot cap hanging on the wall, paper airplanes floating in the air.
