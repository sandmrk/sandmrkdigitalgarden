### 💡 核心观点
今日动作学习：锁定你了！（有没有击中你的心💙) 前面给大家讲过，表情是让你的数字人活起来的第一步。 今天我们更进一步：给人物注入动作，让画面和人物立刻变得更有张力、灵动和冲击力。 这类姿态的关键不在摆手，而在于： 前景透视怎么写清楚，手部结构怎么锁得住，构图与景深怎么配合把力量推到镜头前。 答案👇🏻来吧，上传任意一张图，开始瞄准！！🎯 Photorealistic edit using the input person photo as strict identity reference: keep the same face, facial features, face proportions, skin tone, hairstyle (color/bangs/length/volume), outfit (design/material), and accessories unchanged (no face swap, no new person, no hair/outfit change). Only modify pose/hand gesture, camera perspective, lighting, and background while preserving identity. Facial expression: a subtle mischievous smirk—very slight one-sided corner-of-mouth lift, restrained “bad smile” in the eyes (no big grin, no teeth showing), confident and playful.Pose must replicate this exact extreme-foreshortening hand stack with strict geometry and physical support: both arms are fully extended straight forward toward the camera (straight forearms, straight wrists, rigid extension), creating strong depth. Foreground Hand #1 (lower support tray): the lower hand is pushed closest to the lens and held horizontal like a small table. The back of this hand faces the camera, while the palm creases face upward toward the ceiling (true palm-up orientation). Fingers are fully extended and forcefully splayed to maximum span with visible tension in knuckles/tendons; the palm surface is flat as a platform; heel of the palm appears huge due to proximity. Physical contact constraint: Foreground Hand #2 must be supported by and pressing onto Foreground Hand #1—clear “resting on the tray” relationship with visible contact shadow and slight compression/indentation at the touch area (no floating separation). Foreground Hand #2 (center aiming finger-gun): a rigid straight aiming finger-gun sitting on top of the tray-palm, placed dead-center in the frame and aligned with the camera axis like aiming a pistol. Wrist and forearm fully extended straight; index points directly at the lens (or slightly upward), thumb out, other fingers tightly curled. This aiming hand occludes roughly half of the face (covering one eye/cheek area); only one eye is clearly visible and sharply focused, maintaining intense eye contact through/around the hand. Head & gaze: subtle head tilt (cocked aiming posture), eyes locked on the lens. Camera & framing: ultra-close wide-angle (18–24mm), extremely short camera-to-hand distance; foreground hands occupy ~75–85% of the frame; face and upper torso remain visible behind. Shallow depth of field focusing on the visible eye/upper face; hands may be slightly softer but finger shapes, palm structure, thumb-base orientation, and support contact remain clean and readable. Lighting: clean soft studio lighting with gentle shadows; natural skin texture (light retouch only). Background: solid light-blue seamless studio backdrop, flat and textureless, no objects. Negative: palm-facing-camera, stop-hand gesture, open-palm blocking lens, palm creases facing lens, tray-hand rotated toward camera, tray-hand not horizontal, tray-hand near chest, tray-hand arm bent, tray-hand wrist bent, weak foreshortening, hands separated, floating hands, missing support contact, no contact shadow, no compression, finger-gun not resting on tray, aiming hand off-center, face fully visible, aiming hand not covering face, upright head, zero head tilt, relaxed fingers, floppy pose, incorrect finger-gun, incorrect hand anatomy, extra fingers, missing fingers, fused fingers, broken joints, warped palm, duplicated hands, deformed limbs, unnatural finger length, melted fingertips, blurred finger shapes, heavy motion blur, ghosting, cropped hands, cropped arms, cluttered background, props, text, subtitles, speech bubbles, watermark, logo, frame, cartoon, anime, identity drift
