### 💡 核心观点
[COUNTRY] — ultra-clean infographic poster (editorial + lifestyle) Generated by Google Nano Banana Pro on Gemini app 📱 Full prompt ⤵️ Ultra-clean modern country infographic poster (1080x1080), premium editorial layout meets lifestyle travel photography. Showcase [ENTER COUNTRY NAME] as the hero visual in the center: a slightly angled 3D map cutout / glossy paper-cut map silhouette with subtle shadow, with a small flag pin marker on the capital city. Add a soft natural studio lighting feel, gentle gradient + minimal texture background for an upscale magazine look. Around the hero map, arrange information like a recipe infographic—dynamic, floating panels and clusters, not restricted to top-down. Clear hierarchy: hero map > key stats badges > cities/provinces > culture/foods > tips. SECTION 1 — Quick Facts (clean glassmorphism badges near the hero): - Capital: [CAPITAL] - Population: [POPULATION] - Currency: [CURRENCY] - Language(s): [LANGUAGES] - Time zone: [TIMEZONE] - Best time to visit: [BEST SEASON] Display as modern rounded pills/bubbles with accent color highlights. SECTION 2 — Provinces/States/Regions (ingredients-style clusters): List [NUMBER] provinces/regions with mini icons/mini map segments or simple pictograms. Example: [PROVINCE 1], [PROVINCE 2], [PROVINCE 3]... Each item includes a small icon (mountains, river, desert, forest, coastline) and one short label (e.g., “coastal”, “historic”, “wine region”). Arrange in curved flows connected with thin lines to the map. SECTION 3 — Major Cities (connected pin points): Show 5–8 key cities with small pin markers on/near the map and clean labels: [City 1], [City 2], [City 3]... Use lines/arrows from labels to map pins, avoiding clutter. SECTION 4 — Signature Foods (recipe vibe): Show 4–6 famous foods of [COUNTRY] with small tasty mini illustrations or photo-style cutouts: [Food 1], [Food 2], [Food 3]... Add short descriptors (spicy, street food, dessert, grilled). Keep vibrant natural food colors. SECTION 5 — Culture & Highlights (editorial callouts): Include icons and 1-line notes for: - Famous festival: [FESTIVAL] - Traditional music/dance: [CULTURE] - Landmark(s): [LANDMARKS] - Nature highlight: [NATURE] Use clean vector icons and minimal text. SECTION 6 — Travel Tips (step-like numbered panels): Show 4–6 numbered “tips” panels arranged around the hero map with arrows showing flow: 1) [Tip 1] 2) [Tip 2] 3) [Tip 3] Add small icons (plane, train, hotel, safety, budget, camera, SIM card). Use glassmorphism panels with soft gradients and subtle drop shadows. Typography & Style: Modern sans-serif typography, high readability, strong grid alignment, airy negative space, subtle shadows, crisp vector icons, accent color palette inspired by [COUNTRY] flag (tasteful, not overwhelming). Editorial, premium, ultra-clean, social-feed optimized. Output requirements: Ultra-crisp, no watermark, no logo, no extra text beyond the provided labels, balanced spacing, high contrast readability, 1080×1080.
