### 💡 核心观点
Prompt Studio: Nano Banana Pro Expedition Planning Board, in Firefly An expedition leader's planning board for [JOURNEY / MISSION] — [DESTINATION / ERA]. Left section: route map with topographical detail, waypoints marked, danger zones annotated, and timeline running along the margin. Center section: complete kit layout, every piece of equipment photographed from above in organized rows, weight and function noted, redundancies highlighted, nothing extraneous. Right section: the expedition in progress or the destination achieved, figures in landscape, scale established, the human element against the immense. Visual style transitions from cartographic precision through utilitarian inventory to epic environmental photography. Title block reading "[EXPEDITION NAME] — [ROUTE], [DATE], [OBJECTIVE]".
