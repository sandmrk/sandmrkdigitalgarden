### 💡 核心观点
I asked Nano Banana to deconstruct 4 old complex gadgets from the 1900s. Prompt: <instruction> Input A is a Mechanical Device or Gadget (e.g., Vintage Camera, Mechanical Watch, V8 Engine, Game Console). Deconstruct the object into 3 Functional Layers : Chassis (The Shell): Identify the main body frame or housing. Engine (The Guts): Identify the primary internal mechanism. (e.g., Camera -> Shutter & Mirrors. Watch -> Mainspring & Escapement. Engine -> Pistons). Interface (The Control): Identify the buttons, dials, or lens elements. 2. Container Goal: 'Exploded Construction' Tabletop Photography. Surface: A clean, light-grain Wooden Workbench or cutting mat. Layout: Exploded View (Knolling). The machine is pulled apart into its components, which are arranged spatially to show how they fit together. 3. Construction The Suspension: Major parts (The Chassis) are raised on Miniature Scaffolding or suspended by Miniature Yellow Cranes . The Narrative: A crew of 1:87 Scale Construction Workers (Hard hats, vests) are actively building the machine. Action: They are welding gears, hoisting the lens, or consulting blueprints on the table. Vehicles: Tiny forklifts or flatbed trucks are delivering screws and springs. 4. Visual The Guide Lines: Thin, glowing Blue Laser Lines or holographic wires connect the separated parts, tracing the path of assembly from the table to the suspended parts. The Hardware: Tiny screws, washers, and springs are lined up neatly in rows (Knolling style) on the table, waiting to be installed. 5. Lighting & Atmosphere: Lighting: Bright Studio Light. Even, shadowless illumination (High Key) to ensure every mechanical detail is visible. Texture: Contrast between the matte grey/black of the machine parts and the bright yellow of the construction equipment. Output: ONE image, 1:1 Aspect Ratio, Macro Photography, 'Miniature World' aesthetic, Technical Precision. </instruction>
