### 💡 核心观点
Cross-brand sneaker collaboration 👟 Prompt: [BRAND NAME] Act as a world-class Footwear Design Director and high-end Product Photographer. THE TASK You must autonomously conceptualize and render a hyper-realistic “Concept Sneaker Collaboration” between the input brand and a specialized sports/outdoor brand of your choosing. PHASE 1: DIVERSE PARTNER SELECTION (THE “MATCHMAKER”) CRITICAL: Do NOT default to Nike or Adidas unless they are the absolute 100% perfect archetype match. You must DIVERSIFY the selection. Analyze [BRAND NAME] and identify its core archetype: Luxury, Minimalist, Cyber, Organic, Industrial, Playful. Select the Partner (Archetype Matching): Choose a partner that complements that specific vibe from a wide global roster. If High Tech / Cyber → Gorpcore / Tech (e.g., Salomon, Oakley, ROA, Arc'teryx, Stone Island) If Classic / Heritage → Retro Sport (e.g., New Balance, Reebok, Fila, Lacoste, Saucony) If Performance / Speed → Modern Running (e.g., Hoka, On Running, Mizuno, Asics, Brooks) If Rugged / Utility → Outdoor / Work (e.g., Timberland, Merrell, Vibram, The North Face) The Goal: The collaboration should feel surprising yet inevitable. PHASE 2: PRODUCT DESIGN SPECS (THE HYBRID) Design Language: Invent a highly conceptual, experimental sneaker silhouette that reads as a future design study or speculative prototype, not a commercial product. The form deliberately challenges traditional sneaker proportions and construction logic. The silhouette uses sculptural, non-traditional geometry, with exaggerated volumes, unexpected cut lines, and intentional negative space. The sole unit is fragmented or modular, featuring floating, segmented, or partially suspended midsole/outsole elements. Key functional components (cushioning pods, plates, stabilizers) are visibly exposed or exaggerated, turning performance technology into sculptural design features. Blend the Sports Partner’s signature tooling philosophy with the material language and aesthetic DNA of [BRAND NAME], prioritizing concept over wearability. Branding Integration: Use [BRAND NAME]’s primary color palette and signature patterns/textures structurally rather than decoratively. Integrate the Sports Partner’s technical logo subtly as a functional or molded element, not surface branding. Typography Details: Add crisp, technical micro-typography on the midsole or heel (e.g., “COLLAB_V1”, “CONCEPT PROTOTYPE”, “PATENT PENDING”, material specs) to enhance the high-end, non-commercial prototype feel. PHASE 3: VISUAL EXECUTION (HI-END EDITORIAL) Camera & Angle: Low-angle profile shot, looking slightly up at the shoe to make it feel monumental and dynamic. Razor-sharp focus. Lighting: Ultra-soft, diffused, high-key studio lighting. No harsh shadows. The light must expertly sculpt varied textures (mesh, suede, rubber, plastic, liquid chrome). Background: A seamless, clean, smooth pastel studio cyclorama, with the pastel tone strictly derived from [BRAND NAME]’s color palette. PHASE 4: FOOTER LAYOUT At the bottom center, place two discrete logos side-by-side in monochrome grey: Left: [BRAND NAME] logo Right: the selected Sports/Outdoor partner logo Constraint: The combined width must not exceed 15% of the total image width.
