### 💡 核心观点
Another Nano Banana Pro prompt for visualizing the evolution of inventions. Prompt: a 2x2 grid, each panel with a new random historical invention <instructions> Input Variable: [input] (e.g., Antikythera Mechanism, The Aeolipile (Steam Engine), The Gutenberg Press) System Instruction: Generate a hyper-realistic, macro "Maker's Workbench" showing the evolutionary lineage of an ancient technology. CRITICAL: Do NOT invent futuristic items. Show the Real-World Historical Successors of the artifact. Semantic Lineage Analysis: Analyze the Artifact's Function: What did it do? (e.g., Antikythera = Analog Computer/Calendar). The Evolutionary Tree: Identify 3 distinct successors that exist in real history. Successor A (Medieval/Renaissance): Brass/Wood instrument (e.g., The Astrolabe or Orrery). Successor B (Industrial): Steel/Gear mechanism (e.g., The Marine Chronometer or Mechanical Watch). Successor C (Modern): Silicon/Digital (e.g., A Digital Smartwatch or GPS unit). Container (The Timeline Bench): The Surface: A green self-healing Cutting Mat clutterd with tools. Arrangement: A linear or semi-circle arrangement of 4 Physical Models , moving from Left (Ancient) to Right (Modern). Also a hand holding an unfinished 3D printed version of the artifact. Object Details (The Lineup): Object 1 (The Input): A hyper-realistic verison of the [Input Artifact] The original mechanism. (e.g., The jagged Antikythera rock). Object 2 (Successor A): The Mechanical/Industrial refinement. Object 3 (Successor B): The Electronic/Analog refinement. Object 4 (Successor C): The Digital/Silicon culmination. The Contextual Clutter (The Research): The Blueprint: Underneath the models is a large, hand-drawn Genealogy Chart sketched on graph paper, connecting the Antikythera to the iPhone with arrows. The Screen: BACKGROUND WORKSPACE: Computer monitor displaying 3D modeling software (Blender/ZBrush interface visible) Screen shows wireframe mesh of same object mid-construction Modeling tools visible: topology lines, vertex count, UV mapping Color-coded model sections Lighting & Atmosphere: Style: "Adam Savage / Tested" Workshop Photography. Lighting: High CRI (Color Rendering Index) LED work lights. Very sharp, revealing dust and texture. Depth: Shallow DOF. The front row of models is sharp; the monitor is blurry. 6. BACKGROUND WORKSPACE: Output: ONE image, 16:9 Aspect Ratio, Product Photography, Maker Aesthetic, 8k.
